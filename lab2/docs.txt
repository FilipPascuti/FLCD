Symbol_table was implemented using the concept of a hash table.


    hash_symbol(symbol)
        - this function hashes the input symbol
        - input: a symbol which is of type string
        - output: the the ascii sum modulo the size of the underlying hash table 

    add(symbol):
        - this function adds a symbol to the table if possible
        - input: a symbol of type string
        - output: true if the symbol was added successfully, false otherwise

    search(symbol):
        - this function searched for a symbol in the table 
        - input: a symbol of type string
        - output: true if the symbol is in the table, false otherwise 

    position(symbol):
        - returns a tuple representing the possition of the symbol in the table
        - input: a symbol of type string
        - output: tuple representing the possition of the symbol first value is the hash value and the second is the possition in the bucket
                  if the symbol is not in the table it is added and it's position is returned
    
    remove(symbol):
        - this method removes a symbol from the table
        - input: a symbol of type string
        - output: true if symbol was removed successfully, false otherwise
